# Configuration updates

There are three new configuration options in the `teleport` module:

* `show-clickable-tpa-accept-deny` allows you to enable/disable the accept/deny message when a teleport request is sent
* `use-commands-when-clicking-tpa-accept-deny` forces the accept/deny links to run the `/nucleus:tpaccept` and `/nucleus:tpdeny` commands, rather
 than just accepting/denying (which allows protection plugins that work by blocking the name of the command only to work).
* `use-request-location-on-tp-requests` causes players who accept a teleport request to warp to the location of the target when the request was made, 
rather than the current location of the player, which may help close off a loophole with claim restrictions.

# Bug fixes

* Take into account vanish status properly for some isOnline checks where players do not have permission to see others.
